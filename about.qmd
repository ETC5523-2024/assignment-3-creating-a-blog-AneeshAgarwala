I am Aneesh Agarwal, a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University, specializing in advanced Simulation and Optimization techniques. With a strong foundation in data analysis and a passion for leveraging data to solve complex business problems, I have developed proficiency in R/Python programming and Business Intelligence

My academic journey has equipped me with robust skills in statistical analysis, machine learning, and econometrics, which I have applied in various projects, including a dissertation on the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth in India. Additionally, my hands-on experience with tools like Python, Power BI, and SQL has enabled me to automate data processes and enhance data accuracy in my current part-time role as a Data Entry Consultant.
